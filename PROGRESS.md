# Project Progress Log

## Session: Phone Verification System (Sept 30, 2025)

### ‚è≥ Telnyx SMS Phone Verification (Implemented - Pending Approval)
- Complete phone verification system using Telnyx SMS API
- Two-step verification flow: phone input ‚Üí 6-digit code
- Rate limiting: 5 attempts per hour per phone number
- Code expiration: 5 minutes after generation
- Max 3 verification attempts per code
- Session-based authentication stored in localStorage
- Socket.io integration validates verified sessions before connection

**Status**: Code is complete and deployed. Telnyx phone number (+6498734038) requires documentation review before SMS can be sent. Approval typically takes 24-48 hours. Will test with real phone number once approved.

### üîß Technical Implementation
**Database Schema:**
- Added phone_number, phone_verified, phone_verified_at to sessions table
- Created verification_codes table for temporary code storage
- Migration SQL: src/lib/supabase/migration-phone-verification.sql

**API Routes:**
- `/api/auth/send-code` - Sends 6-digit SMS via Telnyx API
- `/api/auth/verify-code` - Validates code and creates/updates session
- `/api/session/status` - Checks if session_id is still verified

**Frontend:**
- PhoneVerification modal component (src/components/PhoneVerification.tsx)
- Auto-shows on app mount if no valid session exists
- 60-second resend timer with countdown
- Validates phone format using libphonenumber-js

**Socket.io Auth:**
- socket-server.js validates session_id on connection
- Disconnects unverified users with 'auth-required' event
- socket-client.ts includes session_id in connection auth
- Handles auth failures by showing verification modal

### üì¶ Dependencies Added
- axios (^1.12.2) - HTTP client for Telnyx API
- rate-limiter-flexible (^8.0.1) - Rate limiting for SMS endpoints
- libphonenumber-js (^1.12.23) - Phone number validation

### üîê Security Features
- E.164 phone number format validation
- Rate limiting prevents SMS spam
- Code expiration prevents replay attacks
- Attempt limits prevent brute force
- Session validation on every socket connection

## Session: Online User Count + Filter Matching + Auto-Call (Sept 29, 2025)

### ‚úÖ Auto-Call Checkbox (Completed - Sept 29, 2025)
- Checkbox now fully functional (was UI-only before)
- Auto-restarts search 2 seconds after ANY call ends (manual hangup or partner disconnect)
- Shows "Searching for next caller..." message during 2-second delay
- Respects user preference - only auto-restarts when checked
- Fixed stale closure bug using refs to access current state values
- Maintains user's filter preferences during auto-reconnection

### ‚úÖ Interest-Based Filter Matching (Completed - Sept 29, 2025)
- Users can select interests before calling
- Queue system matches users with compatible interests
- Users with overlapping interests get matched together
- Users with no interests match with anyone
- Country filtering marked as TODO (requires geolocation or manual input)
- Tested with multiple browser tabs - filtering works correctly

### ‚úÖ Online User Count Feature (Completed - Sept 29, 2025)
- Server tracks connected Socket.io clients in real-time
- Broadcasts user count on connect/disconnect events
- Homepage displays live count instead of hardcoded "0"
- Tested with multiple browser tabs - count updates correctly
- Socket.io server runs on port 3001, Next.js on port 3000

### üîß Technical Implementation
- Modified socket-server.js to broadcast user count via `io.engine.clientsCount`
- Added `user-count` event listener in socket-client.ts
- Homepage connects to socket on page load to receive live updates
- Fixed WebSocket connection issues by ensuring Socket.io server starts before Next.js

## Session: Database Setup (Sept 29, 2025)

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Set up Supabase project (call_app_1)
- Created database schema with 4 tables:
  - sessions: Anonymous user tracking with interests/country preferences
  - call_history: Last 5 calls per user with timestamps and partner info
  - reports: User reports for moderation (reason, timestamps)
  - bans: Banned users tracking (auto-ban at 3 reports/2hrs)
- Established database connection using Supabase client
- Tested connection successfully

### üîß Technical Notes
- Database credentials currently hardcoded in src/lib/supabase/client.ts
- TODO: Switch to environment variables before production deploy
- Supabase URL: https://skyffnybsqwfbbkbqcxy.supabase.co
- Tables created via SQL Editor, schema stored in src/lib/supabase/schema.sql

### üéØ Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. Online user count - Connect to real Socket.io count (10 min)
2. Connect filters to matching algorithm (20 min)
3. Enable auto-call checkbox (10 min)
4. Call history system - Store/display last 5 calls (1-2 hours)
5. Report system with auto-ban logic (2-3 hours)
6. Additional pages: About, Contact, Blog (1-2 hours)
7. Footer with links (30 min)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
- Environment variables not loading correctly in Next.js 15 + Turbopack
- Using hardcoded credentials as temporary workaround
- Need to fix before Vercel deployment

## [2025-09-29] - Filters UI Complete
**Added:**
- Filters menu slides out from left with smooth animations
- Interests section: text input with tag system (add/remove multiple interests)
- Preferred countries: dropdown selector with flags, up to 3 selections
- Non-preferred countries: same as preferred, for countries to avoid
- Apply button and close functionality
- All filter selections stored in state

**Status:**
- Filters UI fully functional
- Filtering logic not yet implemented (filters don't affect matching yet)

**Next Steps:**
- Connect filters to matching algorithm
- Implement call history feature
- Add report system functionality

## [2025-09-29] - WebRTC Core Complete
**What's Working:**
- Voice calling between users (WebRTC + Socket.io)
- Auto-matching queue system
- Mute/unmute functionality
- Hang up and reconnection
- Basic homepage UI with call/mute/report buttons

**Known Issues:**
- Audio quality is muffled (acceptable for now, will revisit with real users)

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 15.5.4 (App Router, TypeScript)
- simple-peer for WebRTC
- Socket.io for signaling
- Tailwind CSS

**What's Next:**
- ~~Filters UI (interests, countries)~~ ‚úÖ Complete
- Call history feature
- Report system
