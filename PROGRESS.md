# Project Progress Log

## [2025-09-29] - Filters UI Complete
**Added:**
- Filters menu slides out from left with smooth animations
- Interests section: text input with tag system (add/remove multiple interests)
- Preferred countries: dropdown selector with flags, up to 3 selections
- Non-preferred countries: same as preferred, for countries to avoid
- Apply button and close functionality
- All filter selections stored in state

**Status:**
- Filters UI fully functional
- Filtering logic not yet implemented (filters don't affect matching yet)

**Next Steps:**
- Connect filters to matching algorithm
- Implement call history feature
- Add report system functionality
