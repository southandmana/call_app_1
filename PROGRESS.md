# Project Progress Log

## Session: Bug Fixes - Call Restart Issue (Oct 2, 2025)

### ✅ Critical Bug Fixes (COMPLETED)
Fixed two major bugs preventing proper call flow and restart functionality.

**Bug 1: End Call Button Disabled During Connected Calls**
- **Issue:** Button was visible but completely non-functional when clicked during active calls
- **Root Cause:** `disabled={callState !== 'idle'}` was disabling the button during 'connected' state
- **Fix:** Changed condition to `disabled={callState === 'no-users'}` to only disable when no users online
- **File Modified:** `src/app/page.tsx` (line 598)

**Bug 2: Window That Ends Call Cannot Restart**
- **Issue:** Whichever window/tab ended a call would get stuck and unable to start a new call
- **Pattern:** Window 1 ends call → Window 1 stuck, Window 2 can restart. Window 2 ends call → Window 2 stuck, Window 1 can restart
- **Root Cause:** Race condition between `endCall()` and async peer 'close' event
  - Sequence:
    1. `endCall()` sets state to 'idle' (line 249)
    2. `peer.destroy()` triggers async 'close' event (line 232)
    3. 'close' handler fires AFTER `endCall()` completes (line 178-191)
    4. 'close' handler sets state to 'disconnected' - overwrites 'idle'
    5. Next `startCall()` blocked by `connectionState !== 'idle'` guard
- **Fix:** Implemented `isCleaningUp` flag to prevent 'close' handler from changing state during cleanup
  - Line 27: Added `private isCleaningUp: boolean = false`
  - Line 218: Set flag to TRUE before destroying peer
  - Lines 182-185: Check flag in 'close' handler and skip state change if TRUE
  - Line 184: Reset flag AFTER ignoring close event (not before, which was the timing bug)
  - Line 299: Added safety reset at start of `startCall()`
- **Files Modified:** `src/lib/webrtc/manager.ts` (lines 27, 178-185, 215-252, 290-299)

**Debugging Challenges:**
- Encountered aggressive browser caching preventing new code from loading
- Multiple cache-clearing attempts needed (hard refresh, clear .next, DevTools storage clear)
- Added debug logging (`🔴`, `🟡`, `✅` emoji logs) to verify new code was loading
- Discovered timing issue: flag was being reset too early (before async event fired)

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ End Call button now functional during connected calls
- ✅ Both windows can end calls and successfully restart new calls
- ✅ No more stuck states after hanging up
- ✅ Race condition fully resolved with proper flag timing

**Technical Details:**
- The key insight was that `peer.destroy()` triggers an async 'close' event that fires AFTER the `endCall()` function completes
- Resetting `isCleaningUp = false` at the end of `endCall()` was too early
- Solution: Reset flag inside the 'close' handler itself, AFTER skipping the unwanted state change

- Graceful recovery from network issues and permission errors
- 30-second search timeout for "no users available"

### 🎨 Error UI Components
**ErrorModal** - Critical errors requiring user action:
- Microphone permission denied with browser-specific instructions (Chrome/Firefox/Safari)
- WebRTC connection failures with firewall/network troubleshooting tips
- Retry and cancel options

**ErrorToast** - Non-critical notifications:
- Call disconnection alerts
- Reconnection success messages
- Auto-dismisses after 5 seconds
- Slide-down animation

**ErrorBanner** - Persistent connection status:
- "Reconnecting..." when socket connection lost
- "Disconnected" if reconnection fails
- Appears at top of page

### 🔧 Technical Implementation
**WebRTC Manager (src/lib/webrtc/manager.ts):**
- Catches getUserMedia() errors for microphone permission
- Emits custom error events with error types
- Detects peer connection failures
- Tracks connection drops during active calls

**Socket Client (src/lib/webrtc/socket-client.ts):**
- Auto-reconnect on unexpected disconnections

## Session: Phone Verification System (Sept 30, 2025)

### ⏳ Telnyx SMS Phone Verification (Implemented - Pending Approval)
- Complete phone verification system using Telnyx SMS API
- Two-step verification flow: phone input → 6-digit code
- Rate limiting: 5 attempts per hour per phone number
- Code expiration: 5 minutes after generation
- Max 3 verification attempts per code
- Session-based authentication stored in localStorage
- Socket.io integration validates verified sessions before connection

**Status**: Code is complete and deployed. Telnyx phone number (+6498734038) requires documentation review before SMS can be sent. Approval typically takes 24-48 hours. Will test with real phone number once approved.

### 🔧 Technical Implementation
**Database Schema:**
- Added phone_number, phone_verified, phone_verified_at to sessions table
- Created verification_codes table for temporary code storage
- Migration SQL: src/lib/supabase/migration-phone-verification.sql

**API Routes:**
- `/api/auth/send-code` - Sends 6-digit SMS via Telnyx API
- `/api/auth/verify-code` - Validates code and creates/updates session
- `/api/session/status` - Checks if session_id is still verified

**Frontend:**
- PhoneVerification modal component (src/components/PhoneVerification.tsx)
- Auto-shows on app mount if no valid session exists
- 60-second resend timer with countdown
- Validates phone format using libphonenumber-js

**Socket.io Auth:**
- socket-server.js validates session_id on connection
- Disconnects unverified users with 'auth-required' event
- socket-client.ts includes session_id in connection auth
- Handles auth failures by showing verification modal

### 📦 Dependencies Added
- axios (^1.12.2) - HTTP client for Telnyx API
- rate-limiter-flexible (^8.0.1) - Rate limiting for SMS endpoints
- libphonenumber-js (^1.12.23) - Phone number validation

### 🔐 Security Features
- E.164 phone number format validation
- Rate limiting prevents SMS spam
- Code expiration prevents replay attacks
- Attempt limits prevent brute force
- Session validation on every socket connection

## Session: Online User Count + Filter Matching + Auto-Call (Sept 29, 2025)

### ✅ Auto-Call Checkbox (Completed - Sept 29, 2025)
- Checkbox now fully functional (was UI-only before)
- Auto-restarts search 2 seconds after ANY call ends (manual hangup or partner disconnect)
- Shows "Searching for next caller..." message during 2-second delay
- Respects user preference - only auto-restarts when checked
- Fixed stale closure bug using refs to access current state values
- Maintains user's filter preferences during auto-reconnection

### ✅ Interest-Based Filter Matching (Completed - Sept 29, 2025)
- Users can select interests before calling
- Queue system matches users with compatible interests
- Users with overlapping interests get matched together
- Users with no interests match with anyone
- Country filtering marked as TODO (requires geolocation or manual input)
- Tested with multiple browser tabs - filtering works correctly

### ✅ Online User Count Feature (Completed - Sept 29, 2025)
- Server tracks connected Socket.io clients in real-time
- Broadcasts user count on connect/disconnect events
- Homepage displays live count instead of hardcoded "0"
- Tested with multiple browser tabs - count updates correctly
- Socket.io server runs on port 3001, Next.js on port 3000

### 🔧 Technical Implementation
- Modified socket-server.js to broadcast user count via `io.engine.clientsCount`
- Added `user-count` event listener in socket-client.ts
- Homepage connects to socket on page load to receive live updates
- Fixed WebSocket connection issues by ensuring Socket.io server starts before Next.js

---

## Session: Database Setup (Sept 29, 2025)

### ✅ Completed
- Set up Supabase project (call_app_1)
- Created database schema with 4 tables:
  - sessions: Anonymous user tracking with interests/country preferences
  - call_history: Last 5 calls per user with timestamps and partner info
  - reports: User reports for moderation (reason, timestamps)
  - bans: Banned users tracking (auto-ban at 3 reports/2hrs)
- Established database connection using Supabase client
- Tested connection successfully

### 🔧 Technical Notes
- Database credentials currently hardcoded in src/lib/supabase/client.ts
- TODO: Switch to environment variables before production deploy
- Supabase URL: https://skyffnybsqwfbbkbqcxy.supabase.co
- Tables created via SQL Editor, schema stored in src/lib/supabase/schema.sql

1. Online user count - Connect to real Socket.io count (10 min)
2. Connect filters to matching algorithm (20 min)
3. Enable auto-call checkbox (10 min)
4. Call history system - Store/display last 5 calls (1-2 hours)
5. Report system with auto-ban logic (2-3 hours)
6. Additional pages: About, Contact, Blog (1-2 hours)
7. Footer with links (30 min)

### ⚠️ Known Issues
- Environment variables not loading correctly in Next.js 15 + Turbopack
- Using hardcoded credentials as temporary workaround
- Need to fix before Vercel deployment
