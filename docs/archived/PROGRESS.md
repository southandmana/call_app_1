# Project Progress Log

## Session: Production Stability Fixes - Phase 1 Post-Launch (Oct 4, 2025)

### ✅ Critical Production Fixes (COMPLETED)
Fixed 5 critical issues discovered after Phase 1 (Google OAuth) deployment that prevented production use.

**Context:**
Phase 1 (Google OAuth authentication) was completed and deployed on October 4, 2025. Immediately after deployment, several issues surfaced that blocked production functionality. These fixes were implemented in rapid succession to restore full operational status.

**Issues Fixed:**

**1. Railway Build Failure - NextAuth Dependencies**
- **Problem:** Railway build timing out or failing with "Cannot find module 'bcrypt'"
- **Root Cause:** Railway's default `npm ci` command installing ALL package.json dependencies including NextAuth, which is only needed for Vercel frontend
- **Investigation:** Railway build logs showed bcrypt native compilation failing; Socket.IO server doesn't need NextAuth
- **Solution:** Created `nixpacks.toml` configuration file to skip `npm ci` and manually install only required packages: socket.io, @supabase/supabase-js, dotenv
- **Files Changed:**
  - `nixpacks.toml` (new file, project root)
  - `railway.json` (modified to reference nixpacks config)
- **Result:** Build time reduced from timeout to <2 minutes, stable deployments

**2. Runtime Error: "setIsVerified is not defined"**
- **Problem:** Application crashing with ReferenceError when onAuthRequired callback triggered
- **Root Cause:** Leftover code from Phase 1 OAuth migration - `setIsVerified(false);` line referencing removed state variable
- **Investigation:** Browser console showed error in onAuthRequired callback, traced to line 244 in page.tsx
- **Solution:** Removed the single line `setIsVerified(false);` from onAuthRequired handler
- **Files Changed:**
  - `src/app/page.tsx` (line 244 removed)
- **Result:** No more crashes when socket authentication fails

**3. Persistent "Connection lost. Reconnecting..." Banner**
- **Problem:** Socket connection banner displaying "Reconnecting..." even when connection was working
- **Root Cause:** Race condition in socket initialization - socket connecting before userId available from session, server rejecting connection due to missing userId, then reconnecting with userId
- **Investigation:** Socket.IO server logs showed "No userId provided" error followed by successful connection; banner not being cleared on successful reconnect
- **Solution:**
  - Modified useEffect to wait for authenticated session (status === 'authenticated' && session?.user) before calling socketManager.connect()
  - Added userId parameter to socket.connect() call
  - Added `onReconnected()` call in the connect event handler (not just reconnect)
- **Files Changed:**
  - `src/app/page.tsx` (socket connection useEffect)
  - `src/lib/webrtc/socket-client.ts` (connect event handler)
- **Result:** Banner only shows when truly disconnected, clears immediately on successful connection

**4. Ringing Sound Stops on Tab Switch**
- **Problem:** Ringing sound stops playing when user switches browser tabs during call search
- **Root Cause:** NextAuth's default `refetchOnWindowFocus={true}` behavior causes session object to be refreshed when window regains focus → session object reference changes → useEffect cleanup runs → ringing audio stops
- **Investigation:** Console logs showed session object changing when tab switched back; traced to NextAuth's SessionProvider refetch behavior
- **Solution:** Added `refetchOnWindowFocus={false}` to SessionProvider in layout.tsx
- **Files Changed:**
  - `src/app/layout.tsx` (SessionProvider props)
- **Result:** Ringing continues uninterrupted until call connects or user cancels

**5. Broken Call Matching After userId Fix Attempt**
- **Problem:** Random call matching completely stopped working after attempting to fix ringing issue
- **Root Cause:** Changed useEffect dependency array from `[status, session]` to `[status, userId]` which caused useEffect to rerun when userId changed from null (loading) to actual UUID (authenticated) → WebRTC manager destroyed and recreated mid-authentication → breaking call functionality
- **Investigation:** Tested call matching after userId dependency change, no matches happening; browser console showed WebRTC manager being destroyed when userId populated; realized Fix #4 (refetchOnWindowFocus) solves session object stability
- **Solution:** Reverted useEffect dependency back to `[status, session]` - works correctly with `refetchOnWindowFocus={false}` preventing session object changes
- **Files Changed:**
  - `src/app/page.tsx` (reverted useEffect dependencies, removed userId extraction)
- **Result:** Call matching fully restored, works as before Phase 1 migration

**Technical Lessons:**
- Railway requires explicit build configuration to avoid frontend dependencies
- NextAuth SessionProvider behavior significantly impacts useEffect cleanup
- Session object stability more important than extracting individual fields for dependencies
- Race conditions in async authentication require careful useEffect ordering

**Files Modified This Session:**
- `nixpacks.toml` (created)
- `railway.json` (modified)
- `src/app/page.tsx` (3 modifications: removed setIsVerified, fixed socket connection, reverted userId extraction)
- `src/app/layout.tsx` (added refetchOnWindowFocus prop)
- `src/lib/webrtc/socket-client.ts` (added onReconnected call in connect handler)

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Railway builds successfully in <2 minutes
- ✅ No runtime errors on authentication failure
- ✅ Socket connection banner works correctly
- ✅ Ringing sound persists through tab switches
- ✅ Call matching works end-to-end
- ✅ All Phase 1 functionality verified working

## Session: Header Redesign - Online Counter & Circular Buttons (Oct 3, 2025)

### ✅ Header Navigation Polish (COMPLETED)
Redesigned online user counter and converted navigation buttons to circular shape for modern, clean aesthetic.

**Changes Made:**
1. **Online User Counter Redesign:**
   - Replaced "X people online" text with icon-based design
   - Added user group icon (two people silhouette)
   - Wrapped in rectangular container with filled background
   - Background: `var(--bg-tertiary)` - adapts to light/dark themes
   - Border: `1px solid var(--border-primary)`
   - Height: 36px to match adjacent buttons
   - Border radius: 8px (rectangular, distinct from circular buttons)
   - Added `aria-label` for accessibility
   - Padding: `0 12px` for number width variance
   - Layout: Green dot + number + user icon
   - File: `src/app/page.tsx` (lines 495-523)

2. **Navigation Buttons Made Circular:**
   - Filter button: `borderRadius: '8px'` → `'50%'` (page.tsx:541)
   - Account button: `borderRadius: '8px'` → `'50%'` (page.tsx:563)
   - Theme toggle: `border-radius: 8px` → `50%` (ThemeToggle.tsx:56)

**Design Rationale:**
- Shape contrast creates visual hierarchy:
  - Rectangle (counter) = Status/Information display
  - Circles (buttons) = Interactive actions
- Follows Facebook's proven UI pattern (circular action buttons)
- Counter's filled background distinguishes it from transparent buttons
- Maintains flat design aesthetic throughout

**Technical Details:**
- 100% CSS-only changes - zero functional impact
- Theme-aware via CSS variables (auto-adapts to light/dark mode)
- Icon uses standard 20px × 20px size (consistent with other icons)
- SVG inline with `currentColor` for theme compatibility
- All button sizes remain 36px × 36px

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Counter redesign + filter/account button radius
- `src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx` - Theme button radius

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Counter displays correctly with icon and number
- ✅ Layout aligns perfectly with circular buttons
- ✅ Theme switching works (light/dark modes)
- ✅ Number width adapts (1, 12, 123 tested)
- ✅ All buttons remain functional
- ✅ Visual hierarchy clear (rectangle vs circles)
- ✅ Accessibility maintained with aria-label

## Session: UI Refinement - Container Transparency (Oct 2, 2025)

### ✅ Minimalist Design - Transparent Containers (COMPLETED)
Removed visible container backgrounds to create a unified, minimalist appearance while preserving all functionality.

**Changes Made:**
1. **Main Content Container Transparency:**
   - Removed card-like appearance from main content area
   - Changed `background: 'var(--bg-secondary)'` → `'transparent'`
   - Changed `border: '1px solid var(--border-primary)'` → `'none'`
   - Changed `borderRadius: 'var(--space-lg)'` → `'0'`
   - File: `src/app/page.tsx` (lines 494-500)

2. **ControlBar Container Transparency:**
   - Removed pill-shaped background from button container
   - Changed `background: 'var(--bg-secondary)'` → `'transparent'`
   - Changed `border: '1px solid var(--border-primary)'` → `'none'`
   - Changed `borderRadius: '32px'` → `'0'`
   - Changed `boxShadow` → `'none'`
   - File: `src/components/ControlBar.tsx` (lines 81-84)

**Design Rationale:**
- Creates unified background appearance across entire app
- Buttons and content now float directly on page background
- Maintains all spacing, layout, and structure
- Minimalist aesthetic with no visual containers

**Technical Details:**
- 100% CSS-only changes - zero impact on functionality
- All flexbox layouts preserved
- All event handlers unchanged
- All state management intact
- Padding and positioning maintained for proper spacing

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Main container transparency
- `src/components/ControlBar.tsx` - Button container transparency

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ All functionality preserved
- ✅ Layout and spacing unchanged
- ✅ Unified minimalist appearance achieved
- ✅ No visual or functional regressions

## Session: Bug Fixes - Call Restart Issue (Oct 2, 2025)

### ✅ Critical Bug Fixes (COMPLETED)
Fixed two major bugs preventing proper call flow and restart functionality.

**Bug 1: End Call Button Disabled During Connected Calls**
- **Issue:** Button was visible but completely non-functional when clicked during active calls
- **Root Cause:** `disabled={callState !== 'idle'}` was disabling the button during 'connected' state
- **Fix:** Changed condition to `disabled={callState === 'no-users'}` to only disable when no users online
- **File Modified:** `src/app/page.tsx` (line 598)

**Bug 2: Window That Ends Call Cannot Restart**
- **Issue:** Whichever window/tab ended a call would get stuck and unable to start a new call
- **Pattern:** Window 1 ends call → Window 1 stuck, Window 2 can restart. Window 2 ends call → Window 2 stuck, Window 1 can restart
- **Root Cause:** Race condition between `endCall()` and async peer 'close' event
  - Sequence:
    1. `endCall()` sets state to 'idle' (line 249)
    2. `peer.destroy()` triggers async 'close' event (line 232)
    3. 'close' handler fires AFTER `endCall()` completes (line 178-191)
    4. 'close' handler sets state to 'disconnected' - overwrites 'idle'
    5. Next `startCall()` blocked by `connectionState !== 'idle'` guard
- **Fix:** Implemented `isCleaningUp` flag to prevent 'close' handler from changing state during cleanup
  - Line 27: Added `private isCleaningUp: boolean = false`
  - Line 218: Set flag to TRUE before destroying peer
  - Lines 182-185: Check flag in 'close' handler and skip state change if TRUE
  - Line 184: Reset flag AFTER ignoring close event (not before, which was the timing bug)
  - Line 299: Added safety reset at start of `startCall()`
- **Files Modified:** `src/lib/webrtc/manager.ts` (lines 27, 178-185, 215-252, 290-299)

**Debugging Challenges:**
- Encountered aggressive browser caching preventing new code from loading
- Multiple cache-clearing attempts needed (hard refresh, clear .next, DevTools storage clear)
- Added debug logging (`🔴`, `🟡`, `✅` emoji logs) to verify new code was loading
- Discovered timing issue: flag was being reset too early (before async event fired)

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ End Call button now functional during connected calls
- ✅ Both windows can end calls and successfully restart new calls
- ✅ No more stuck states after hanging up
- ✅ Race condition fully resolved with proper flag timing

**Technical Details:**
- The key insight was that `peer.destroy()` triggers an async 'close' event that fires AFTER the `endCall()` function completes
- Resetting `isCleaningUp = false` at the end of `endCall()` was too early
- Solution: Reset flag inside the 'close' handler itself, AFTER skipping the unwanted state change

## Session: Phone Verification System (Sept 30, 2025)

### ⏳ Telnyx SMS Phone Verification (Implemented - Pending Approval)
- Complete phone verification system using Telnyx SMS API
- Two-step verification flow: phone input → 6-digit code
- Rate limiting: 5 attempts per hour per phone number
- Code expiration: 5 minutes after generation
- Max 3 verification attempts per code
- Session-based authentication stored in localStorage
- Socket.io integration validates verified sessions before connection

**Status**: Code is complete and deployed. Telnyx phone number (+6498734038) requires documentation review before SMS can be sent. Approval typically takes 24-48 hours. Will test with real phone number once approved.

### 🔧 Technical Implementation
**Database Schema:**
- Added phone_number, phone_verified, phone_verified_at to sessions table
- Created verification_codes table for temporary code storage
- Migration SQL: src/lib/supabase/migration-phone-verification.sql

**API Routes:**
- `/api/auth/send-code` - Sends 6-digit SMS via Telnyx API
- `/api/auth/verify-code` - Validates code and creates/updates session
- `/api/session/status` - Checks if session_id is still verified

**Frontend:**
- PhoneVerification modal component (src/components/PhoneVerification.tsx)
- Auto-shows on app mount if no valid session exists
- 60-second resend timer with countdown
- Validates phone format using libphonenumber-js

**Socket.io Auth:**
- socket-server.js validates session_id on connection
- Disconnects unverified users with 'auth-required' event
- socket-client.ts includes session_id in connection auth
- Handles auth failures by showing verification modal

### 📦 Dependencies Added
- axios (^1.12.2) - HTTP client for Telnyx API
- rate-limiter-flexible (^8.0.1) - Rate limiting for SMS endpoints
- libphonenumber-js (^1.12.23) - Phone number validation

### 🔐 Security Features
- E.164 phone number format validation
- Rate limiting prevents SMS spam
- Code expiration prevents replay attacks
- Attempt limits prevent brute force
- Session validation on every socket connection

- Shows "Searching for next caller..." message during 2-second delay
- Respects user preference - only auto-restarts when checked
- Fixed stale closure bug using refs to access current state values
- Maintains user's filter preferences during auto-reconnection

### ✅ Interest-Based Filter Matching (Completed - Sept 29, 2025)
- Users can select interests before calling
- Queue system matches users with compatible interests
- Users with overlapping interests get matched together
- Users with no interests match with anyone
- Country filtering marked as TODO (requires geolocation or manual input)
- Tested with multiple browser tabs - filtering works correctly

### ✅ Online User Count Feature (Completed - Sept 29, 2025)
- Server tracks connected Socket.io clients in real-time
- Broadcasts user count on connect/disconnect events
- Homepage displays live count instead of hardcoded "0"
- Tested with multiple browser tabs - count updates correctly
- Socket.io server runs on port 3001, Next.js on port 3000

### 🔧 Technical Implementation
- Modified socket-server.js to broadcast user count via `io.engine.clientsCount`
- Added `user-count` event listener in socket-client.ts
- Homepage connects to socket on page load to receive live updates
- Fixed WebSocket connection issues by ensuring Socket.io server starts before Next.js

## Session: Database Setup (Sept 29, 2025)

### ✅ Completed
- Set up Supabase project (call_app_1)
- Created database schema with 4 tables:
  - sessions: Anonymous user tracking with interests/country preferences
  - call_history: Last 5 calls per user with timestamps and partner info
  - reports: User reports for moderation (reason, timestamps)
  - bans: Banned users tracking (auto-ban at 3 reports/2hrs)
- Established database connection using Supabase client
- Tested connection successfully

### 🔧 Technical Notes
- Database credentials currently hardcoded in src/lib/supabase/client.ts
- TODO: Switch to environment variables before production deploy
- Supabase URL: https://skyffnybsqwfbbkbqcxy.supabase.co
- Tables created via SQL Editor, schema stored in src/lib/supabase/schema.sql

### 🎯 Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. Online user count - Connect to real Socket.io count (10 min)
2. Connect filters to matching algorithm (20 min)
3. Enable auto-call checkbox (10 min)
4. Call history system - Store/display last 5 calls (1-2 hours)
5. Report system with auto-ban logic (2-3 hours)
6. Additional pages: About, Contact, Blog (1-2 hours)
7. Footer with links (30 min)

### ⚠️ Known Issues
- Environment variables not loading correctly in Next.js 15 + Turbopack
- Using hardcoded credentials as temporary workaround
- Need to fix before Vercel deployment

- Non-preferred countries: same as preferred, for countries to avoid
- Apply button and close functionality
- All filter selections stored in state

**Status:**
- Filters UI fully functional
- Filtering logic not yet implemented (filters don't affect matching yet)

**Next Steps:**
- Connect filters to matching algorithm
- Implement call history feature
- Add report system functionality
