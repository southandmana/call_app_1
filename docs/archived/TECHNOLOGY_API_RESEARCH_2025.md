---

### Final Recommendation: **AWS SNS for Basic Needs, Plivo for Scale**

**Reasoning:**
- **Start with AWS SNS:** Free tier (100 SMS/month) is perfect for early testing and MVP launch. At $0.0025-$0.0073 per message, it's the cheapest option.
- **Scale with Plivo:** Once you exceed AWS free tier and need more than basic SMS, switch to Plivo at $0.005/message with free inbound SMS.

## 6. Emergency/Panic Button Integration

### Recommended Approach: Twilio + Geolocation API

#### Implementation Strategy

**Core Components:**
1. **Twilio SMS + Voice:** Send emergency alerts to contacts
2. **Browser Geolocation API:** Get user's real-time location (built-in, FREE)
3. **Google Maps Geocoding API:** Convert coordinates to readable address
4. **Custom Backend Logic:** Orchestrate emergency response

#### Architecture Example (Based on Research)

**Panic Button Flow:**
1. User presses panic button in app
2. Frontend captures location via `navigator.geolocation` (FREE, built-in)
3. Backend receives alert with coordinates
4. Geocode location using Google Maps API
5. Trigger Twilio to:
   - Call primary emergency contact
   - Send SMS to 5 additional contacts with location
   - Include Google Maps link to exact location

**Reference Implementation:**
- GitHub project "WalkSafe Home" demonstrates this exact pattern
- Uses React + Twilio + Geolocation
- Open source and well-documented

---

#### Pricing Breakdown

**Twilio Costs:**
- **SMS:** $0.0079 per message × 5 contacts = $0.04 per panic alert
- **Voice Call:** ~$0.01/min for US calls
- **Total per panic event:** ~$0.05-$0.10

**Google Maps Geocoding:**
- First 28,000 requests/month: FREE ($200 credit)
- After free tier: $5.00 per 1,000 requests
- Cost per panic alert: Essentially FREE with monthly credit

**Total Cost per Panic Button Use:** $0.05-$0.10

---

#### Pros
- Cost-effective (~$0.05 per use)
- Reliable (Twilio infrastructure)
- Real geolocation without additional APIs
- Can include Google Maps link in SMS
- Fast response time
- Easy to implement
- Reference implementations available

#### Cons
- Requires user location permissions
- Accuracy depends on device GPS
- Not a certified emergency service connection
- Won't directly alert 911/authorities

---

#### Legal Considerations

**Important Notes:**
1. **DO NOT automatically call 911:** This can result in legal liability and false emergency responses
2. **Provide clear disclaimers:** Not a replacement for official emergency services
3. **User responsibility:** Make it clear users should call 911 directly for life-threatening emergencies
4. **Terms of Service:** Include liability waivers for emergency feature use
5. **Location accuracy disclaimer:** GPS can be inaccurate indoors or in urban canyons

**Recommended Approach:**
- Primary emergency contact receives voice call
- Additional contacts receive SMS with:
  - Alert message
  - User's location (coordinates + address)
  - Google Maps link
  - Timestamp
  - Suggestion to call user or authorities if needed

---

### Final Recommendation: **Custom Twilio + Browser Geolocation Solution**

**Cost:** ~$0.05-$0.10 per panic button activation
**Implementation Time:** 1-2 days with reference examples
**Ongoing Cost:** Minimal (only pay when used)

This is significantly cheaper and more flexible than third-party panic button services, which can cost $10-50/month per user.

1. System prompt (cached): Matching algorithm, personality framework, criteria
2. User A profile (input): Interests, preferences, responses
3. User B profile (input): Interests, preferences, responses
4. Request compatibility analysis (output)
```

**Batch Processing Strategy:**
- Run matching algorithms overnight or during low-traffic hours
- Process 100-1000 potential matches in batch
- 50% discount on all tokens
- Users see "new matches" next morning

**Cost Example (Optimized):**
- 10,000 matches/month
- With caching + batching: $10/month
- Without optimization: $45/month
- GPT-4 equivalent: $600/month

**ROI:** Claude with optimization saves $590/month vs GPT-4, or $7,080/year.
