# TODO: Pending Tasks

## Phone Verification - PENDING APPROVAL ‚è≥

### Telnyx Number Activation
- [ ] Wait for Telnyx documentation approval (check email in 24-48 hours)
- [ ] Once approved, test SMS sending with real phone number
- [ ] Verify rate limiting works (5 attempts/hour per phone)
- [ ] Test code expiration (5 minutes)
- [ ] Test max attempts per code (3 attempts)
- [ ] Test Socket.io auth enforcement (disconnects unverified users)
- [ ] Test session validation on page reload

**Note**: Phone verification code is complete and committed. Telnyx phone number (+6498734038) requires documentation review before it can send SMS. This is a standard Telnyx compliance requirement.
