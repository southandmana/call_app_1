## 🚨 LAUNCH READINESS - Required Before Public Release

### BLOCKING ISSUES (Cannot launch without these)

#### Legal Compliance (Est: 2-3 days + legal review)
- [ ] **Terms of Service document**
  - User conduct rules (no harassment, hate speech, illegal activity)
  - Liability limitations (not responsible for user meetups)
  - Account termination policy (ban conditions)
  - Dispute resolution process
  - **Action**: Draft or hire lawyer ($500-2000)
  - **Risk**: Launching without ToS = no legal protection

- [ ] **Privacy Policy document**
  - What data is collected (phone numbers, call metadata, IP addresses, session data)
  - How data is stored and protected (Supabase encryption, Telnyx compliance)
  - Data retention periods (how long we keep call history, reports)
  - User rights (access, deletion, portability under GDPR/CCPA)
  - Third-party services (Telnyx, Supabase, Vercel)
  - Cookie policy
  - **Action**: Draft or hire lawyer ($500-2000)
  - **Risk**: GDPR fines up to €20M or 4% revenue, CCPA fines up to $7,500 per violation

- [ ] **Age Verification Enhancement**
  - Current: Phone verification only (insufficient legal protection)
  - Required: Government ID verification or credit card check
  - Liability risk: Minors accessing dating platform = massive legal exposure
  - Alternatives:
    - Telnyx Identity Verification (~$0.50/check)
    - Stripe Identity (~$1.50/check)
    - Manual ID review (labor intensive)
  - **Action**: Implement ID verification (2-3 hours integration)
  - **Risk**: COPPA violations = $50,120 per violation, potential criminal charges

#### Safety Infrastructure (Est: 1-2 weeks)
- [ ] **Moderation System**
  - Who reviews reports? (You? Hire moderator? Automated AI?)
  - Response time SLA (24 hours? 72 hours?)
  - Escalation process for serious threats (suicide, violence, minors)
  - Moderator training materials
  - **Action**: Define process, hire moderator ($15-25/hr) OR implement automated review
  - **Cost**: $2,000-4,000/month for part-time moderator

- [ ] **Incident Response Plan**
  - What happens when user reports assault/harassment after meetup?
  - Contact law enforcement protocol (when and how?)
  - Evidence preservation (call logs, reports, ban history)
  - Victim support resources (hotlines, counseling services)
  - Documentation requirements for legal requests
  - **Action**: Write documented procedure (1 day)
  - **Risk**: Improper handling = lawsuits, bad PR, regulatory scrutiny

- [ ] **Content Moderation Policy**
  - Instant ban: Threats, hate speech, solicitation, minors, drugs
  - Warning: Spam, mild rudeness, excessive disconnects
  - Manual review: Gray areas, appeals
  - Appeals process (how users contest bans)
  - Ban duration (permanent vs temporary)
  - **Action**: Write policy document (4-6 hours)
  - **Risk**: Inconsistent moderation = discrimination lawsuits

## Phone Verification - PENDING APPROVAL ⏳

### 🚨 CURRENT STATUS: BYPASSED FOR TESTING
**Phone verification is currently DISABLED via feature flag to allow friend testing before Telnyx approval.**

**Feature flag location**: `.env.local`
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BYPASS_PHONE_VERIFICATION=true  # Currently bypassed for testing
```

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Before Public Launch Checklist
- [ ] **MUST DO**: Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BYPASS_PHONE_VERIFICATION=false` in .env.local
- [ ] Restart Next.js dev server
- [ ] Restart Socket.io server
- [ ] Test that phone verification modal appears
- [ ] Verify unverified users cannot connect to Socket.io

### Telnyx Number Activation (Waiting 24-48 hours)
- [ ] Wait for Telnyx documentation approval (check email)
- [ ] Once approved, test SMS sending with real phone number
- [ ] Verify rate limiting works (5 attempts/hour per phone)
- [ ] Test code expiration (5 minutes)
- [ ] Test max attempts per code (3 attempts)
- [ ] Test Socket.io auth enforcement (disconnects unverified users)
- [ ] Test session validation on page reload
- [ ] **AFTER TESTING WORKS**: Set bypass flag to `false` in production

**Note**: Phone verification code is complete and committed. Telnyx phone number (+6498734038) requires documentation review before it can send SMS. This is a standard Telnyx compliance requirement. The bypass flag allows testing with friends in the meantime.
