## Risk Assessment

### Critical Risks (Must Address Before Launch):
1. **Legal liability**: Assault/harassment after meetups

2. **COPPA violations**: Minors accessing platform
   - **Mitigation**: ID verification, age gate, moderation
3. **GDPR/CCPA fines**: Data privacy violations
   - **Mitigation**: Privacy policy, data deletion, consent
4. **Platform ban**: App store rejection
   - **Mitigation**: Web-first, comply with app store rules

### Medium Risks (Monitor and Mitigate):

   - **Mitigation**: Photo verification, phone verification
2. Spam and abuse
   - **Mitigation**: Rate limiting, report system, auto-ban
3. Poor audio quality

   - **Mitigation**: Push notifications, email campaigns, premium features

### Low Risks (Accept or Defer):
1. Scalability issues at 10K+ users
   - **Accept**: Cross that bridge when we get there
